The binary calculator features a clean interface using Bootstrap and custom CSS for styling. It allows users to input binary numbers and operators (+, -, *, /) using buttons. The input(ch) function appends the selected value to the display, while the calculate() function performs binary arithmetic by converting inputs to decimal, computing the result, and converting it back to binary. The backspace() function removes the last character, and the cls() function clears all input, preparing for new calculations. Users can view real-time updates in the styled output display.
